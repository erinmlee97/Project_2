# Project 2 Proposal
## Project Topic: 
Escaping 2020 on Earth, Time to Move to A Galaxy Far, FAR Away!
	After experiencing the whirlwind that has been the year 2020, our group has decided to search for an alternative home.  Through the examination of planets, species, and climates, as well as an analysis of spacecraft, we will determine the best place to relocate.

Group members: Lisa Allred, Carlie Azar, Erin Lee, John Swierczynski

GitHub Repo: https://github.com/erinmlee97/Project_2 

Track: A custom “creative” D3.js project (i.e., a nonstandard graph or chart)

User Interactions: clickable axis, navigation bar (drop down or buttons)

Data Sources:  Star Wars API: https://swapi.dev/documentation

Final Visualizations: 
Starships - constant X axis of “name” and then a changing y axis of - “consumables”, “cost in credits”, and “hyperdrive rating”
Planets - constant X axis of “name” and then a changing y axis of - “surface water”, “population”, ”orbital period”, and “rotation period”
Also include a data frame with climate and terrain by planet name
Species - a visual TBD that has name, height, and life span
Also include a data frame with classification and language by species name
Vehicles - constant X axis of “name” and then a changing y axis of - “passengers”, “cost in credits”, and “max atmosphering speed”

Task Breakdown:
-Extract the data from the API to house in CSV files in our database (TBD) as back up
Determine the new JS library to use
-Set up flasks: 
    Homepage
    Starships
    Planets
    Species
    Vehicles
-Set up HTML and CSS
-Use JS to manipulate the data and create the visualizations
-Cleaning up the HTML and finalize pages with context/analysis

Project Requirements:
Your visualization must include a Python Flask–powered RESTful API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).
Your project should fall into one of the below three tracks:
A custom “creative” D3.js project (i.e., a nonstandard graph or chart)
A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.
Your project must be powered by a data set with at least 100 records.
Your project must include some level of user-driven interactions.
Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.
